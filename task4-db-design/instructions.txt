Task 4 – DB Schema Design for Webhook Logs (30 minutes)

Goal:
Design a SQL table for storing webhook logs for payment gateway events.

Requirements:
- Support multiple attempts for the same transaction
- Store raw JSON payload
- Store retry count
- Store processing status and timestamps
- Be efficient to query: failed webhooks, last attempt per transaction, daily stats

Deliverable:
- A .sql file (or SQL snippet in instructions.txt) that creates the table with indexes.
